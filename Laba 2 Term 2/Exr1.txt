It is required to implement a function for parsing and computing arithmetic
a mathematical expression represented as a string. 
On input such function must take a pointer to the original string and a double pointer x, 
by which should be stored. At the output, it must return
integer code value, according to the following table:

• (code = +0) - the function worked without errors; the result of the expression was
written to address x;
• (code = +1) - division by zero;
• (code = +2) - the expression is incorrect; incorrect bracket alignment;
• (code = +3) - the expression is incorrect; incorrect arrangement of operation signs;
• (code = +4) - An incorrect character was found when parsing the expression.
