It is required to realize the trapezoid method for the numerical integration of some
of the given function f(x) on the interval [a, b].
In the trapezoid method, the initial segment is divided into a set of n sub-cuts
of equal length, on each of which the value of the integral is calculated approximately
(as the area of the trapezium formed by its extreme points and the corresponding
marks on the function graph).
The calculation formula obtained in this way has the following form(formula.png)

In the case when the function f(x) is continuous on the whole interval [a, b], with n ascending
to infinity T (f, a, b, n) converges to the exact value of the integral.
To achieve a given accuracy ε> 0, a sequence τk = T (f, a, b, 2^k · N), where n is the size of the initial partition,
k = 0, 1,. . . . The process will is stopped in the case if | τk - τk-1 | < ε either the number of iterations of k 
exceeds some threshold value m.
The solution of the problem must be formalized in the form of a function that accepts at the input
a pointer to a real-valued function f(x), a and b, and parameters n, ε and m.
